# Overview

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using C# and Windows Forms to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts in C#, such as object-oriented programming, event handling, and graphical user interface (GUI) development. The software enables two players to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe in turns, providing a functional interface that detects wins, ties, and invalid moves.

The purpose of writing this software was to gain hands-on experience in developing GUI applications in C#, better understand how to work with event-driven programming, and improve problem-solving skills by implementing game logic in a structured way.
